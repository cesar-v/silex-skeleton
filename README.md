Silex Skeleton
==============

Boilerplate code to kick start your Silex project.

I like Silex because it's minimal. You don't have a lot of extra junk that you're app doesn't use. 
I also like Laravel, but my biggest compliant with it is that you have a bunch of additional 
files/directories for features you may never use.

Enter this skeleton.  Inspired by Laravel, yet simple enough to give you only what you need while 
leaving room for any necessary growth in the future.

Features
--------

### Vagrant 
Comes with a simple development environment thanks to [scotchbox](https://box.scotch.io/).  If 
you're not familiar with Vagrant, I recommend visiting [vagrantup.com](http://vargrantup.com).  Once 
everything is installed, simply run

    vagrant up

from CLI and you now have a fully functional development environment at 
[http://192.168.33.22/](http://192.168.33.22/)

### Views

Again, I'm a big fan of **KISS** - **K**eep **I**t **S**imple **S**tupid.

I don't see the need of a heavy template engine when PHP has native templating abilities.  This 
skeleton comes prepackaged with [cesarv/views](https://github.com/cesar-v/views), but it's pretty 
easy to change the view provider if need be.


Happy coding!
